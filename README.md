The Playlist Manager is a Java application designed to manage playlists, tracks, and their properties. It provides functionalities for creating playlists, adding tracks, sorting tracks, moving tracks between playlists, copying tracks, and deleting tracks.

2. Track Management: Users can add new tracks to playlists, delete tracks from playlists, and view the details of tracks (title, artist, year of release) through simple console commands.
3. Sorting: Tracks within playlists can be sorted alphabetically by track name, enhancing organization and ease of access to music collections.
4. Moving and Copying Tracks: Users can move tracks from one playlist to another or copy tracks between playlists using intuitive console prompts, allowing for flexible organization of music libraries.
5. Error Handling: The application includes robust error handling mechanisms to prevent invalid operations, such as adding duplicate playlists or tracks, ensuring data integrity and user satisfaction.
